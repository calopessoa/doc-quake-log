title: Quake 3 Match Log Viewer
---

The Quake 3 Match Log Viewer creates two condensed database JSON files.

Since the data is static, imageless and quite light, no true cloud database were upped.

This databse focuses in bringing up to the user two cards: Game Data of each match and Death Cause of each match

- Game Data will cover the **game(id)**, **total-kills**, **players**, **kills** and **top-players** .

- Death Cause will cover **game(id)**, **kills-by-means** .
